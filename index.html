                        Absolutely thrilled with Shaylinn's exceptional service! She's incredibly knowledgeable and consistently goes above and beyond to ensure everything is done perfectly. My brakes are now wonderfully quiet, and the engine is running smoothly thanks to the oil change. What truly stands out is her efficiency - she completes the work quickly without compromising quality. I wholeheartedly recommend her services!

                        Thankyou so much to Shay Extra Mile Auto Care for coming out and changing my oil!
                        Her communication, personality and work ethic was amazing. It's really hard nowadays to find time to do things like that so thankyou SO much !
                        Make sure to book with Shay next time you need your oil changed family/friends.

                        Shaylinn and Zackary are absolutely awesome and should handle all your mechanical needs!! Had them do a Transmission fluid change and the price was unbeatable! They got here when they said they were, took them no time at all and they even looked over other things that were concerning that I wasn't even aware about! Absolutely awesome human beings who deserve all the work you got!
